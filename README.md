## Overview
This project implements a **bottom-up Dynamic Programming** solution to the
Change-Making Problem.  
The goal is to compute the **minimum number of coins** needed to make a target
value \( V \) and to **reconstruct the actual coins used**.

The project also compares the DP solution with the **Largest Coin First greedy
strategy**, showing that greedy does not always produce optimal results.
